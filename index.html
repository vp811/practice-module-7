        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>A Day to Remember (often abbreviated ADTR) is an American rock band from Ocala, Florida, founded in the spring of 2003 by guitarist Tom Denney and drummer Bobby Scruggs. They are known for their amalgamation of metalcore and pop punk. The band currently consists of vocalist Jeremy McKinnon, rhythm guitarist Neil Westfall, bassist Joshua Woodard, percussionist/drummer Alex Shelnutt and lead guitarist Kevin Skaff.</p>

        <p>Signing with Indianola Records for their first album, And Their Name Was Treason (2005), Scruggs was replaced by Shelnutt in 2006. Later that year the band recorded For Those Who Have Heart (2007) for Victory Records. They embarked on several tours of the UK and U.S. and played at several festivals before recording and releasing Homesick (2009). While promoting Homesick on tour, Denney was replaced by Skaff. Soon after releasing their next album, What Separates Me from You (2010), the band went on a worldwide tour to promote it. Since 2011, the band has been involved in a lawsuit with Victory Records over their recording contract. In October 2013 the band was given the right to self-release new albums until a final verdict is reached. They released their fifth album, Common Courtesy, that month. In 2016, the band released their sixth album, Bad Vibrations. They're set to release their seventh album You're Welcome on March 5, 2021 and will be their first release under Fueled by Ramen.</p>

        <h3>History</h3>
        <h4>Early years and debut album (2003–2006)</h4>
        <p>After all playing in different groups in the Ocala music scene, singer Jeremy McKinnon, guitarists Neil Westfall and Tom Denney, bassist Joshua Woodard, and drummer Bobby Scruggs came together in 2003.[1] Soon after, the band embarked onto playing well over 200 shows in their first year of touring, making a name for themselves in the U.S.[1]</p>

        <p>The band self-released an independent EP[2] titled Halos for Heroes, Dirt for the Dead in 2004, which was sold at their live shows.[3] Their epononymous and second EP, moreso a demo rather, was released in January 2005; this was a precursor to their debut studio album and contained demo versions of six songs.</p>

        <p>They were signed to Indianola in February 2005,[4] for which they released their debut album, And Their Name Was Treason (2005) in May that year. It went on to sell over 10,000 copies.[5][6]</p>

        <p>Woodard said, "A friend of mine said he had the AIM screenname of someone at Victory Records. I didn't believe him, but I still started communicating with the guy. We IM'ed back and forth for about six months, and it happened that we were playing [...] in a town outside of Chicago. [...] It was our first time we ever played in Illinois, yet the 50–60 kids there were singing along to our tunes like they’d been fans all their lives."[1]</p>

          <h4>Victory Records and For Those Who Have Heart (2006–2008)</h4>
          <p>Soon after signing with Victory,[7] the band with their new drummer Alex Shelnutt went into Zing Studios to record their second album.[1] The album, titled For Those Who Have Heart, was released in January 2007 on Victory[8] and peaked at number 17 on Billboard's Top Heatseekers chart.[9]</p>

          <p>In September 2007, they posted a cover of Kelly Clarkson's song, "Since U Been Gone", on their MySpace page.[10] This was later featured on the re-release of For Those Who Have Heart, released in February 2008,[11] and charted at number 43 on the Top Independent Albums chart.[9]</p>
